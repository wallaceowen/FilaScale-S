# FilaScale-S
Simple through-hole board implementing a no-gui FilaScale

This is a small Arduino Nano-based board designed to implement the sensor suite of a FilaScale
but without a GUI, and using through-hole parts.

It was built to the requirements of a filament monitoring device.  The board provides:

* Humidity, temperature and weight monitoring of a spool of filament in a drybox
* RFID tag reader
* Serial communications with a host over USB
